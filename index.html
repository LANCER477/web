    <h1><b>Vehicle</b></h1><br>
    <p>A vehicle (from Latin: vehiculum<sup><span style="color:blue"> [1]</span></sup>) is a machine that transports people or cargo. Vehicles include wagons, bicycles, motor vehicles (motorcycles, cars, trucks, buses), railed vehicles (trains, trams), watercraft (ships, boats), amphibious vehicles (screw-propelled vehicle, hovercraft), aircraft (airplanes, helicopters) and spacecraft.<sup><span style="color:blue"> [2]</span></sup>
    </p>
    <p>Land vehicles are classified broadly by what is used to apply steering and drive forces against the ground: wheeled, tracked, railed or skied. ISO 3833-1977 is the standard, also internationally used in legislation, for road vehicles types, terms and definitions.<sup><span style="color:blue"> [3]</span></sup></p>

    <p style="font-size: 13pt" > Two households, both alike in dignity,<br>
        In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,<br>
        From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,<br>
        Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.<br>
        From forth the fatal loins of these two foes<br>
        A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;<br>
        Whose misadventured piteous overthrows<br>
        Do with their death bury their parents' strife.<br>
        The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,<br>
        And the continuance of their parents' rage,<br>
        Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,<br>
        Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;<br>
        The which if you with patient ears attend,<br>
        What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend. </p>
